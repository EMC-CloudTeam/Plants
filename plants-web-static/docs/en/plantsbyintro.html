      <p>Plants by WebSphere is an Internet storefront that specializes in the 
        sale of plants and gardening tools. This Sample application uses many 
        of the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) and WebSphere Application Server functions, including enterprise 
        beans, servlets, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology.</p>
      <p>Using the Plants by WebSphere storefront, 
         customers can open accounts, browse for items to purchase, view product 
         details, and place orders. The Plants by WebSphere application uses container-managed 
         persistence (CMP), container-managed relationships (CMR), stateless session beans, 
         a stateful session bean, JSP pages, and servlets.</p>
